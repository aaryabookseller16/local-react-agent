"""Split extracted PDF text into overlapping chunks that carry page numbers.

The whole module works with spans, meaning (start, end) pairs of character
offsets into the original text, with end exclusive. Text is only sliced out
at the very end, in chunk_text. Carrying offsets instead of strings is what
lets every chunk report the pages it came from, and it keeps repeated text
(headers, boilerplate) from being confused with itself.

Sizes are measured in CHARACTERS, not tokens. For English, tokens are roughly
characters / 4, so size=2000 is about 500 tokens. That ratio is an estimate;
check it against a real PDF before trusting a context budget.
