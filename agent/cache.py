"""Per PDF cache of derived artifacts, keyed by the file's content hash.

The hash identifies the INPUT: rename the file and the cache still hits,
edit the file and the cache misses. The manifest records the SETTINGS that
produced each artifact, so changing chunk size, a model, or a prompt
invalidates what those settings produced even though the PDF is unchanged.
Input identity and output validity are different questions.
